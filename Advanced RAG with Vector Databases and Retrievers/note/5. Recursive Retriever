Recursive Retriever - Multi-Level Reference Following
The Recursive Retriever is designed to follow relationships between nodes using references.
It can follow references from one node to another, such as citations in academic papers or other metadata links, allowing it to retrieve related content across documents or layers of abstraction.

How it works (from authoritative source):
Follows node references - traverses relationships to find referenced content
Supports chunk and metadata linking - handles different types of references
Multi-Level Navigation: Can execute sub-queries on referenced retrievers or query engines
Network Building: Creates a network of interconnected retrievers that can reference each other

Reference Types Supported:
Chunk References: Smaller child chunks refer to larger parent chunks for additional context
Metadata References: Summaries or generated questions refer to larger content chunks, such as citations in academic papers

When to use (based on authoritative guidance):
Academic papers with citations and extensive references
Research papers where you need to retrieve relevant content from cited papers
Documentation with cross-references and linked content
Knowledge bases with interconnected information
When nodes reference structured data (tables, databases, other documents)

Configuration:
retriever_dict: Maps node IDs or keys to specific retrievers
query_engine_dict: Maps keys to query engines for sub-queries
Node metadata can contain references to other nodes or data structures
Key capability: Retrieves related content across documents by following reference chains

Strengths:
Follows complex relationships and enables multi-step reasoning
Provides comprehensive coverage across related documents
Excellent for handling interconnected information systems
Can traverse multiple levels of references automatically

Limitations:
Requires careful setup of node relationships
Can be computationally expensive for deep reference chains
Complex debugging when reference chains are extensive
May retrieve too much related content if not properly configured
