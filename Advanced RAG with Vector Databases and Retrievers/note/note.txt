What are Advanced Retrievers?
Advanced retrievers in LlamaIndex are sophisticated components that go beyond simple vector similarity search to provide more nuanced, context-aware, and intelligent information retrieval.They combine multiple techniques such as:

Semantic Understanding: Using embeddings to understand meaning and context
Keyword Matching: Precise term-based search for exact specifications
Hierarchical Context: Maintaining relationships between different levels of information
Multi-Query Processing: Generating and combining results from multiple query variations
Fusion Techniques: Intelligently combining results from different retrieval methods
Why are Advanced Retrievers Important?
Improved Accuracy: Advanced retrievers can find more relevant information by using multiple search strategies
Better Context Preservation: They maintain important relationships between pieces of information
Reduced Hallucination: More precise retrieval leads to more accurate AI responses
Scalability: Efficient retrieval strategies work better with large document collections
Flexibility: Different retrieval methods can be combined for optimal results



Index Types Overview
Before exploring advanced retrievers, it's helpful to first understand the three main index types supported by LlamaIndex.
Each is designed to support different retrieval scenarios:

VectorStoreIndex:

Stores vector embeddings for each document chunk
Best suited for semantic retrieval based on meaning
Commonly used in LLM pipelines and RAG applications

DocumentSummaryIndex:
Generates and stores summaries of documents at indexing time
Uses summaries to filter documents before retrieving full content
Especially useful for large and diverse document sets that cannot fit in the context window of an LLM

KeywordTableIndex:
Extracts keywords from documents and maps them to specific content chunks
Enables exact keyword matching for rule-based or hybrid search scenarios
Ideal for applications requiring precise term matching
