Relative Score Fusion Mode
Relative Score Fusion normalizes retrieval scores relative to the maximum score within each query variation's results,
enabling effective combination when you want to preserve score magnitude information across different query formulations.

How it works within QueryFusionRetriever:
Generates multiple query variations using LLM
Retrieves results for each query variation
Normalizes each query's scores by dividing by the maximum score in that query's results
Creates scores in the range [0, 1] where 1 is the best result from each query variation
Combines normalized scores using weighted average or sum

Mathematical approach:
normalized_score_i(d) = score_i(d) / max_score_i
combined_score(d) = Σ (weight_i × normalized_score_i(d))

Why Relative Score Fusion is valuable for query variations:
Preserves score magnitudes: Unlike RRF, retains information about how confident each query was about its results
Fair combination: Ensures no single query variation dominates due to different scoring scales
Interpretable results: Final scores reflect the relative strength across query variations
Flexible weighting: Can weight certain query formulations more heavily if desired

When to use Relative Score mode:
When you trust the embedding model's confidence scores
For queries where score magnitudes are meaningful
When different query variations should contribute proportionally to their confidence
In scenarios where you want to understand why certain results ranked highly

Configuration within QueryFusionRetriever:
Automatically handles score normalization across query variations
Equal weighting of all query variations by default
Preserves relative differences in retriever confidence

Advantages:
Preserves valuable score magnitude information
Intuitive normalization approach
Works well when retriever scores are reliable
More interpretable than pure rank-based methods

Limitations:
Sensitive to outlier scores within individual query results
Assumes retriever scores are meaningful and comparable
May not handle unreliable scoring mechanisms well
